# Video player
Video player web project In this project or web app you can play video on a browser. `Vanilla JavaScript`, `CSS`, `HTML` these languages are used for creating this project. `Vanilla JavaScript` plays important role in this project. mainly used to adjust the video's volume, seek the video and play and pause the video. and helps to operate video players using keyboard keys.

**The list of keys used to operate the video player is below.**
- ` k ` key used for play and pause the video.
- ` m ` key used to mute and unmute the video.
- ` p ` key used to play the video in picture in picture mode.
- ` f ` key used for the toggle to the full-screen mode.

I have used some in-built APIs for access functionality like the picture in picture and full-screen mode.
**The list of APIs used for this project is below.**
- `Media API` **_or_** `HTMLMediaElement` interface basically used for play and pause the video.
 - `PictureInPicture API` is used to play the video in picture in picture mode.
 - `FullScreen API` as the name indicates that it is used for the toggle to the fullscreen.
 `HTML` and `CSS` used for UI and Design. Especially for icons i've use special `HTML`'s `<svg>` tag. `<svg>` tag used for preview vector images and also helps the load image faster.
